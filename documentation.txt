loadLevel() has no values passed into it. It will load and return a previously defined template level into a 2D array. Imagine the returned array is assigned to the name "level" like this: level = loadLevel(). The characters inside this 2D array will be accessed like this: level[y][x], where y is the row of the level, and x is the column of that row. For example level[2][4] will be the 5th character in the 3rd row of the level. Remember that addressing starts at 0.
